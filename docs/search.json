If one confesses and the other stays silent, the confessor is rewarded and the silent prisoner receives a harsh sentence. If both confess, they receive moderate sentences. The dominant strategy for each is to confess, even though both would prefer the outcome where they remain silent. This logic also applies to:- Joint projects where working is costly - Environmental agreements - Price competition - Public‑goods situations. A dominated strategy is one that always yields a lower payoff than another. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, staying silent is dominated.

    "text": "This book introduces the fundamental ideas of game theory—the study of strategic interaction between rational decision‑makers. The goal is to develop intuition first, mathematics second, and insight throughout.The chapters build progressively from simple ideas like dominant strategies to more advanced concepts such as sequential games, mixed strategies, and repeated interaction.\n\n2 What is Game Theory?\nGame theory studies rational interactive decision‑making. Unlike standard optimization—where a decision affects only the outcome, game theory analyzes situations where your outcome depends on the actions of others. Examples include:\n\nAthletes choosing tactics in sports\n\nBusinesses setting prices or advertising levels\n\nGovernments choosing spending, taxes, or military strategies\nStudents choosing effort levels in a group project\n\nEveryday strategic choices such as which route to take or whether to cooperate\n\nGame theory separates two parts of performance:\n\nSkill — mechanical or physical ability\n\nStrategy — anticipating and responding to others’ choices\n\nThis book focuses on the strategic part and for the most part assumes that players have the skill to execute their actions.\n\n\n3 Definitions\nA game arises when a person is aware that his/her actions affect another individual and that the actions of the other individual(s) affect him/her. A game has the following components:\n\nPlayers: at least two decision makers\n\nActions: choices available to each player\nStrategies: complete plans of action\nPayoffs: the benefits or consequences that result from the choices\n\nRules: who moves when, what they know, and how outcomes are determined.\n\n\n\n4 Classifying Games\nGames in game theory are broadly classified by the timing of players’ actions as either simultaneous or sequential. In simultaneous-move games, players choose their strategies concurrently, without observing each other’s actions, as in the classic Prisoner’s Dilemma where two suspects decide independently whether to confess or remain silent. This setup introduces strategic uncertainty, as each player must anticipate the other’s choice based on beliefs rather than direct observation. In contrast, sequential games involve players moving in a prescribed order, with subsequent players able to condition their strategies on prior observable actions, such as in the game of chess or a Stackelberg duopoly where a leader firm sets output before followers respond. Additionally, games differ in the alignment of players’ interests: zero-sum games feature complete conflict, where one player’s gains exactly equal another’s losses (e.g., poker), while non-zero-sum games allow for mutual benefit or cooperation, as in the Battle of the Sexes where players prefer coordinating on the same action despite differing preferences.\nGames may also be categorized by their duration: one-shot (or normal-form) games are played exactly once, forcing players to evaluate payoffs based solely on immediate incentives, often leading to myopic behavior like defection in a single Prisoner’s Dilemma. Repeated games, however, extend over multiple periods—either finitely or infinitely—enabling strategies that condition future play on past outcomes, such as tit-for-tat in an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, which fosters cooperation through the threat of retaliation or promise of reciprocity. Repetition introduces the folk theorem, which posits that a wide range of payoff profiles, including cooperative ones, can be sustained as equilibria if players are sufficiently patient (high discount factor), highlighting how dynamic interaction transforms short-term conflict into long-term gains.\nA critical dimension of games concerns information availability, introducing uncertainty that shapes strategic reasoning. External uncertainty arises from exogenous factors like weather affecting crop yields in a farming game, while strategic uncertainty stems from ignorance of opponents’ past moves or concurrent decisions. Games with neither—where every player observes the full history of play at each decision node—are termed perfect information games, exemplified by tic-tac-toe. Departures yield imperfect information games. Separately, complete information assumes all players know the game’s structure, strategies, and payoffs; incomplete (or asymmetric) information occurs when players possess private knowledge, such as types or valuations (e.g., in auctions where bidders know their own value but not others’), leading to Bayesian equilibria where beliefs about hidden information guide choices.",

    "text": "0.1 Decision‑Making Begins with One Rational Player\nEvery day, whether we notice it or not, we make decisions: which route to take to school, whether to buy a coffee now or later, or whether to take an umbrella in case of rain. Some decisions are trivial; others—like choosing an investment, negotiating a contract, or launching a new product—have consequences that matter. Yet all of them share a common feature: we choose an action without fully knowing what the world will deliver in return.\nThis book introduces a systematic way to think about such choices. We begin with the simplest setting—a single decision‑maker facing a well‑defined problem—and gradually build toward strategic environments, where multiple rational individuals interact. The goal is to build a foundation strong enough to support the more complex ideas of game theory, while ensuring the logic feels natural and intuitive.\nGame theory ultimately studies how multiple decision‑makers interact, but the journey starts with just one of them. Before we analyze competition, negotiation, or conflict, we must first understand what it means for a lone decision‑maker to behave rationally.\nIn this book, a decision‑maker is rational if:\nAt its core, rationality is about consistency, not genius. A rational person can be misinformed, unlucky, optimistic, or pessimistic—but given what they believe and what they want, their decisions follow a coherent rule.",

    "text": "0.6 From Individual Decisions to Strategic Interaction\nOnce we master single‑player decisions under uncertainty, we are ready for the next leap. Up to now, uncertainty came from nature—weather, markets, geology, luck. But in strategic settings, uncertainty comes from other rational players. Their choices affect your outcomes, and your choices affect theirs.\nThis creates a new layer of complexity: each player must consider what others know, believe, and plan to do. Expected value still matters, but beliefs are now about the actions of others, not just random events. Decision trees remain useful, but now they include multiple decision‑makers, each optimizing their own payoff. These are the foundations of game theory—the study of rational interaction. The rest of the book builds from this foundation.\n\nPeople make choices based on what they prefer When people face different options—things they could choose—they make decisions based on their preferences. That simply means:\n\n\nSome outcomes are liked better than others.\nSometimes two outcomes are equally good.\nPeople compare outcomes to figure out what they want most.\n\n\nPreferences have certain “reasonable” qualities\n\nTo study decision-making, economists assume that preferences behave in predictable ways.\n✔ Completeness A person can compare any two options and say which they prefer (or that they don’t care between them).\n✔ Transitivity If you prefer A to B, and B to C, you should also prefer A to C. (Without this, choices could become inconsistent or circular.)\n✔ Continuity (explained loosely) Small changes in an option shouldn’t suddenly flip someone’s preference in an extreme way.\n✔ Independence How you rank two outcomes shouldn’t depend on irrelevant details or on other options not being chosen.\nThese assumptions basically give structure to preferences so they make sense mathematically.\n\nActions lead to outcomes\n\nChoices are made from a set of actions, and each action leads to a certain outcome.\nExamples: Choosing a job offer → income, work environment, lifestyle changes Choosing what to buy → different bundles of goods Choosing a route → total travel time\nOutcomes can be simple or complicated, but the key idea is that decisions matter because they lead to different results.\n\nBehavioral models vs. “rational” models One section notes that there are different ways to model behavior:\n\n\nRational choice theory assumes people carefully weigh options and pick the “best” one based on stable preferences.\nBehavioral economics accepts that real people often make mistakes, have biases, or rely on shortcuts (heuristics).\n\nPeople aren’t perfectly rational, but the rational model is still very useful for predicting human behavior.",
