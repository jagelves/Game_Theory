    "text": "3.1 The Classic Prisoner’s Dilemma\nTwo prisoners are separated and interrogated. Each must choose:- Confess (Rat)- Deny (Stay Silent) If both stay silent, they receive light sentences. If one confesses and the other stays silent, the confessor is rewarded and the silent prisoner receives a harsh sentence. If both confess, they receive moderate sentences. The dominant strategy for each is to confess, even though both would prefer the outcome where they remain silent. This logic also applies to:- Joint projects where working is costly - Environmental agreements - Price competition - Public‑goods situations. A dominated strategy is one that always yields a lower payoff than another. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, staying silent is dominated. The tragedy is that individual incentives destroy collective welfare.",
