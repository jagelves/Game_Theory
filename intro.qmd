# Introduction

This book introduces the fundamental ideas of **game theory**—the study of strategic interaction between rational decision‑makers. The goal is to develop intuition first, mathematics second, and insight throughout.The chapters build progressively from simple ideas like dominant strategies to more advanced concepts such as sequential games, mixed strategies, and repeated interaction.


# What is Game Theory?
Game theory studies **rational interactive decision‑making**.  Unlike standard optimization—where a decision affects only the outcome, game theory analyzes situations where **your outcome depends on the actions of others**. Examples include:

- Athletes choosing tactics in sports  
- Businesses setting prices or advertising levels  
- Governments choosing spending, taxes, or military strategies 
- Students choosing effort levels in a group project  
- Everyday strategic choices such as which route to take or whether to cooperate 

Game theory separates two parts of performance:

1. **Skill** — mechanical or physical ability  
2. **Strategy** — anticipating and responding to others’ choices

This book focuses on the **strategic** part and for the most part assumes that players have the skill to execute their actions.

# Definitions
A *game* arises when a person is aware that his/her actions affect another individual and that the actions of the other individual(s) affect him/her. A game has the following components:

- **Players**: at least two decision makers  
- **Actions**: choices available to each player
- **Strategies**: complete plans of action
- **Payoffs**: the benefits or consequences that result from the choices  
- **Rules**: who moves when, what they know, and how outcomes are determined.
